**A:** TraceX supports all modern Windows PCs (Windows 10 and 11). If you‚Äôre running Windows and your game has a hardware ban, TraceX will work. It‚Äôs been tested on dozens of popular titles (Fortnite, COD, Rust, etc.) and is continuously updated for new games and anti-cheats.

**Q: Is it safe to use? Can I get banned for using TraceX?**  
**A:** TraceX is designed to be as safe as possible. It doesn‚Äôt inject cheats or modify game files; it only changes your system‚Äôs IDs. Thousands of players have used it without issues. However, misuse of any spoofer could violate some games‚Äô terms of service, so use it responsibly. We recommend using TraceX to regain access for legitimate play, not to continue cheating.

**Q: Do I need a new game account after spoofing?**  
**A:** If your game account was permanently banned, you will likely need a new account to play (spoofing can‚Äôt unban an account).

**Q: Does TraceX work on consoles or other platforms?**  
**A:** No, TraceX is a Windows PC tool. Console bans (on Xbox, PlayStation, etc.) are managed differently and TraceX will not work on those. It‚Äôs intended for PC gamers on Windows.
